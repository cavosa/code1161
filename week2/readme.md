Things I learnt:

1. How to define a function and populate it with lines of code
2. How to comment
3. How to clean up code and eliminate syntax errors.
4. I learnt about the method '.uname()' from the 'platform' module.
5. I learn about assigning containers like lists to variables.
6. I learnt how to append items to an empty list using the .append method.
7. I learnt about nested for loops.

Things I'm still unclear:

2. Still don't know the difference between print() and return.
3. Still unclear about some of the questions in exercise 3 that I failed to attempt.
